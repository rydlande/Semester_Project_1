              Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The
              Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know
              about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
              constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about
              the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.  Follow the
              journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to
              Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in
              our solar system.

              For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
              question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
              here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
              framework for exploring and understanding our place in this
              world.  Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the
              species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take
              some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive,
              including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs
              too.

              From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
              biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of
              the tiny world.   For many people their life expectancy is much
              longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the
              growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits
              we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major
              breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first
              heart transplant.   Many of our great medicinal discoveries have
              come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the
              wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

              The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
              intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
              applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is
              here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

              As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
              planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how
              to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the
              whole planet.  In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the
              dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of
              species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we
              can all contribute to a brighter future.
